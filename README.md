- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tannemann
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python Coding for Data Analysis, reading and writing data files, creating insights
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m also interested in coding games. SImple ones like a figure running around, jumping over things, collecting points and advance to the next level. Very basic.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub :)
- ğŸ“« How to reach me ... can you reach me here on GitHub?
